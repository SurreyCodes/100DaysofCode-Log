# My goals: Complete Udemy course - Javascript the weird parts.
# - start using GitHub every day.
# - read Speaking Javascript by Dr. Axel Raushmayer
# - Watch You Tube series on Underscores (23 videos), write tests to try out each function.
#   Each lesson's tests are posted to github.
#   Get back on track with FCC - continue section on algorithms.
#   Run JSPerf tests on my FCC algorithms and other algorithms posted.
